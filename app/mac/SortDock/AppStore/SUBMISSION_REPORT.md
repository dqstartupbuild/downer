# Submission report

Status: the previous 1.0 review submission is removed; build 1.0 (5) is validated, uploaded, and processing; no new review submission was created.

## Source and product

- Branch: `main`; starting HEAD for this release fix: `d9674aa2f42214ba9a256dbfb707f76c963e1383`.
- Destination setup now uses the native macOS folder panel during onboarding and from destination menus.
- The folder panel allows creating folders, and reconnecting a destination saves its new path and security-scoped bookmark together.
- Security-scoped bookmarks, keyword precedence, file-type fallback, and conflict-safe naming remain in place.

## Testing

- Debug build: passed.
- Unit tests: passed, 4 tests.
- Release analyze: passed.
- Metadata, screenshot, and icon validation: passed.
- Xcode Organizer validation: passed all App Store Connect checks for 1.0 (5).
- The archive contains Intel and Apple Silicon executables.
- UI automation does not drive the system folder panel. Native panel behavior was verified through the AppKit configuration and the focused destination flow review.

## App Store Connect

## Archive and upload

- Archive: `/Users/starship/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2026-08-25/SortDock 8-25-26, 11.58 PM.xcarchive`
- Created 2026-08-25 23:58 America/Detroit; Intel and Apple Silicon; version 1.0 build 5.
- Xcode validation passed all checks. App Store Connect upload succeeded just after midnight; Organizer shows `Uploaded to Apple`.

## Remaining blockers

1. Wait for build 1.0 (5) to finish processing and select it for the next submission.
2. The owner must decide price and territory availability; no value was guessed.
3. The owner may keep or replace the five screenshots currently present using `AppStore/screenshots/final/2880x1800`.

The previous submission was removed. `Add for Review`, `Submit for Review`, and release controls were not used for build 1.0 (5).
